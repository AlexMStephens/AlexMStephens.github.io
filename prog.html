        <h3>I program.</h3>
        <p>Some of my spare time is occupied by a few programming projects. Of note are a game engine I am building, and a GUI toolkit. These projects are for my own amusement and curiosity, and do not involve any ground-breaking ideas. They are written with the C programming language. When the time is right I will release the source code for anyone curious. To see a video with a brief demonstration of the game engine in a very early form, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YSEJC5_ce9U">click here</a>.</p>
	<p>The programming language I am most comfortable with is C. I have also worked in Java, Python, R, Lisp, C++, assembly for x86_64 CPU architecture, and Minecraft redstone.</p>
